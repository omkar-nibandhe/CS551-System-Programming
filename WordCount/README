Assumptions:
STOP_WORD_FILE have atleast 1 word/char i.e ' to remove single occurances of apostrophe (').
It takes time to run the executable as the I/O operations are huge. Be a little patient.

Data Structures:
A hash table with simple hash function is used on the basis of length of the word. Then the bucket is selected to insert the word if already not present.
 Insertion is make a bit cheaper by adding the node at the start. Resources are saved to traverse till the end while inserting.

Every hash has a linked list which points the char * word and the int frequency which stores the frequency of the word.

After all the words from multiple files have been included the function calculateMAX() starts to calculate the N maximum words. As each word is unique entity it is counted seperatedly so different words with same frequency are considered seperate words. Final results are stored in a linked list and displayed at the end.
