Assumptions:
-client and server run in the same directory.
-daemon does not close the stdin, stdout, stderr.
-File accessibility is checked on client side to reduce some load on daemon.
-DELIMITOR is "*" which will not be present in any file name of path name. 
-Lexicographically precedence is considered.
-Long word still has issues, as mailed to TA previously.
-On successfull completition, the client and workerprocess will clean up the resources created to communicate.
-Some memory free has been done, not all.
-"Make" will complie and create .mod file modules for dyamic loading, any other loading modules should be taken care seperately before running.
-If any run time error happends in worker process, appropriate error message is sent to client and client is terminated along with worker processs.
-Error condition on worker process is handled by sending 1024 bytes error message as a word with frequency set to 0.


TO RUN:
-simply type make in the extracted folder. The daemon will start print it's pid and wait for request.
-Client has to be executed by the format specified in the program statement.
-type make clean to clean FIFO (Client-Server: SERVER_FIFO)


Data Structures:
-Hash Table implemented for sublinear insertion.

Checked on remote.cs.binghamton.edu and on LINUX environment.
